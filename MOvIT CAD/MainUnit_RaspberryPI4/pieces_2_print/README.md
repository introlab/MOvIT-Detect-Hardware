# There is 2 differents version of the cover
The first version has been tested and works fine. The "clip_down" version should hold on more, but has not been tested.

# Printing specification
Because of the shape of the cover, it will be easier to print in 2 parts (and glue them with acetone). Simply print one of the "plain" file and the "battery_protector" file.

If you directly want the full cover, just print one of the "complet" file.
